            <p> A Pairing Staircase visually represents who has paired with whom and how often. Pair Stairs are most often associated with Paired Programing, an Agile Software Development technique, but can be used for any activity that involves pairing.</p>
            <p> One of the possible reasons to use a Pairing Staircase during software development is to ensure that every developer pairs with every other developer. Pairing helps with knowledge sharing throughout the development team and the staircase will help visualize gaps in the knowledge sharing chain. </p>
